## What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
interface is the blueprint of object.An iterface tell the object what kind of properties it's can hold.
And Type is what kind of data it can hold and its used to alis the type.
ex:type username = "string" .now we can assign this value after a variable using colon.
Type gives us more flexibilty then interface .
